# KnowTeX: Knowledge Dependency from TeX

**KnowTeX** is a standalone Python GUI tool that analyzes LaTeX projects to construct **knowledge dependency graphs** among mathematical statements and proofs.  
It expands your TeX project, parses the document structure, extracts labeled environments, and visualizes how results depend on one another via `\uses{...}` and `\proves{...}` annotations.

Derived from [Patrick Massot’s *plastexdepgraph* plugin](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/plastexdepgraph), KnowTeX provides similar functionality **without requiring PlasTeX or Lean blueprints**. 

**Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID)**

Portions of the KnowTeX project were developed with the assistance of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, OpenAI GPT-5). These tools were used to help draft Python code, suggest refactoring patterns, and improve documentation clarity. All generated code was reviewed, tested, and validated by the author, who assumes full responsibility for the final implementation and design decisions.

## Features

- Parses a full LaTeX project following:
  - `\input`, `\include`, `\import`, `\subimport`, and `\includeonly`.
- Detects canonical mathematical environments and aliases.
- Tracks logical dependencies between results through:
  - `\uses{...}`, and `\proves{...}`.
- Generates:
  - **Graphviz DOT** and **TikZ** output (`.dot`, `.tex`),
  - Optional **zoomable PNG preview**.
- GUI features:
  - Chapter selection dialog (only scan chosen `\chapter{...}` sections),
  - Environment inclusion toggles,
  - Transitive reduction toggle (for simpler graphs),
  - Interactive zoom/pan of dependency graph.

## Supported Environments

KnowTeX recognizes the following canonical theorem-like environments (case-insensitive, with aliases such as `defn`, `thm`, `lem`, etc.):


| Canonical | Common Aliases | Shape | Border Color | Fill Color |
|------------|----------------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **definition** | `definition`, `defn`, `def` | ▢ box | Purple | Lavender |
| **theorem** | `theorem`, `thm`, `th`, `thrm` | ◎ doublecircle | Blue | SkyBlue |
| **lemma** | `lemma`, `lem`, `ilemma`, `alemma` | ◯ ellipse | Blue | SkyBlue |
| **proposition** | `proposition`, `prop`, `propn`, `prp` | ◆ diamond | Blue | SkyBlue |
| **corollary** | `corollary`, `cor`, `corol`, `corl` | ◯ ellipse | Blue | White |
| **construction** | `construction`, `const`, `constn`, `constr` | ◆ diamond | Purple | White |
| **example** | `example`, `examples`, `iexample` | ◯ ellipse | DimGray | White |
| **remark** | `remark`, `remarks` | ◯ ellipse | DimGray | White |

This legend determines how nodes are drawn in the dependency graph.

## `\uses{...}` and `\proves{...}` Commands

### `\uses{label1,label2,...}`
Declares that the current **statement** (or **proof**) *depends on* or *uses* previously labeled results.

- In a **statement environment** (`theorem`, `lemma`, etc.):  
  Indicates conceptual dependency — the result builds upon these labels.
  Edges from `\uses{...}` in a statement appear as **dashed arrows** in the dependency graph.
- In a **proof environment**:  
  Indicates logical references used *within the proof* of the current result.
  Edges from `\uses{...}` in a proof appear as **solid arrows** in the dependency graph.


### `\proves{label}`
Declares that the current **proof** *establishes* a particular labeled statement.

- Typically appears **inside a proof environment** (e.g. `\begin{proof}...\end{proof}`).
- If omitted, the proof is assumed to prove the **most recent statement** encountered.

## Example

```latex
\begin{definition}\label{def:ring}
A ring is a set with two operations satisfying ...
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ring-unit}
\uses{def:ring}
In a ring, if $1=0$ then every element is zero.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Trivial from the axioms.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:trivial-ring}
\uses{def-ring}
If a ring satisfies $1 = 0$, then it is the trivial ring $\{0\}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
\uses{lem:ring-unit}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:ring-unit}, if $1 = 0$, then every element equals $0$.  
Hence the ring contains only one element, $0$, and is therefore the trivial ring.
\end{proof}
```

Produces a graph with:
- a **Definition node** (“def:ring”),
- a **Lemma node** (“lem:ring-unit”),
- a **Corolllary node** ("cor:trivial-ring),
- a **dashed edge** from the definition node to the lemma node.
- a **dashed edge** from the definition node to the corollary node.
- a **solid edge** from the lemma node to the corollary node.

## Installation

**Requirements**

- Python ≥ 3.8  
- Packages:  
  ```bash
  pip install pylatexenc pygraphviz dot2tex Pillow
  ```
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) (must be on system `PATH`)

**Linux**
```bash
sudo apt install graphviz
```
**macOS**
```bash
brew install graphviz
```
**Windows**
Install Graphviz and add `Graphviz/bin` to your PATH.

---

## Usage

### 1. Launch GUI
```bash
python KnowTeX.py
```

### 2. Select your main `.tex` file
- The program expands all `\input` / `\include` files.
- Optionally select which `\chapter{...}` sections to include.

### 3. Choose environments and scan
- Check which categories (theorems, lemmas, etc.) to include.

### 4. Visualize or export
- **Preview**: opens a zoomable graph in the GUI.  
- **Generate DOT + TikZ**: saves `dep_graph.dot` and `dep_graph.tex`, but user can edit the name of the output files.

## Notes

- When `\includeonly{...}` is used, only those chapters are loaded.
- The “Nonreduced” option disables transitive reduction (keeps all edges).
- Zoom/pan gestures:
  - Ctrl + scroll = zoom
  - Left-drag = pan
  - “Fit” and “100%” buttons reset view.
